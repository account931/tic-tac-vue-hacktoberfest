# tic-tac-Vue Framework
- <p> Tic-tac-tac on Vue Framework 2.5. </p>
- <p> Same as JQuery Tic-tac-toe but implemented on Vue Framework 2.5. +  </p>
- <p> + uses Vue router + </p>
- <p> + this Vue project uses Vue-sweetalert2 (ordinary sweetAlert works Ok on {npm run dev}, but does not work in build (i.e in /dist folder)), while JQ Tic-tac-toe uses both Sweet Alert 2 and Sweet Alert 1 </p>

- <p> Vue-sweetalerts difference from ordinary SweetAlert => </p>
     - <p> instead of Swal.fire({})                  => use => this.$swal  (or sometimes Vue.swal) </p>
     - <p> instead of let Toast = Swal.mixin({})     => use => let Toast = this.$swal.mixin({      </p>
     

# How it works 
- <p> Built based on JQuery variant but transfered to Vue Framework. </p>
- <p> Main game component is 'src/component/TicTac/TicTacStart.vue'. It uses function computedAnswer(), outlined to external separate js file '/sub_functions/computedAnswer.js'. 
      While outlining had to modify the function by adding arg (this) => computedAnswerFile.computedAnswer(this); Otherwise, {this} is unavailable in subfunction 
  </p>
  
- <p> Main logic for building/drawing the game field was outlined from 'src/component/TicTac/TicTacStart.vue.' to a 'sub_components/gameField.vue' (for a purpose of cleaner code) 
      Game field is build based on array gameHits[], due to reactivity we do not need to rebuild the game field (like in JQuery) after every user hit.   
      We pass vats {horizontal, vertical, gameHits} from 'TicTacStart.vue.' to 'gameField.vue' as props + pass a parent function mainUserClick() to be able to fire it from child component.
          <draw-game-field  :verticalX  ="this.vertical" :horizontalX="this.horizontal" :gameHitsX  ="this.gameHits" @myEventX="mainUserClick"/>
 </p>
 
 - <p> While outlining 'sub_components/gameField' faced the issue: if in subcomponent in nested for loops u can't get passed from Parents props, then use computed to get them, see => 'sub_components/gameField'</p>     
 - <p> NB: remember that while adding an el to array (i.e adding hits) to maintain reactivity use this.gameHits.splice(item, 1, "x"); not this.gameHits[item] = "x"
        Use splice this way => this.gameHits.splice(item, 1, "x"); //(what array el index to start with, delete 1, new value)
  </p>
  
  - <p> Router & menu are in App.vue </p>
